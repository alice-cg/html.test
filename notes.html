<p> A markup is a special text which tells html how to diplay stuff <br> </p>

<p>br brakes <br>
<em> em is for italicising text </em> <br>
<sub> abc </sub> <br>
<sup> abc </sup> </p>
<strong> makes it bold </strong>

<p> block line elements create blocks around content vs inline element which just flow with the text </p>

<p> To create an ordered list you have to: <br>
<ol> <li> write the opening tag ol
<li> add elements to the list with the tag li
  <ul> <li>remember that li doesn't necessarily need a closing tag as html will infer it
  <li> ol and ul on the other hand alwyas require closing tags</ul>
<li> write a closing tag</ol></p>
