<p> need the tag !DOCUTYPE html to turn your script into a document, the document then needs to have two parts:
 <ol>
  <li> head:NEEDS to contain the title of the page (it's gonna be displayed in the tab) plys it can include scripts, cascading style sheets, metadata (e.g. keywords for search engines)
  <li> where most of the actual contents are (images, links lists, etc)
 </ol>

<p> A markup is a special text which tells html how to diplay stuff <br> </p>

<p> This is a list of markups: 
 <ul> 
    <li>br brakes <br>
    <li><em> em is for italicising text </em> <br>
    <li><sub> abc </sub> <br>
    <li><sup> abc </sup> 
    <li><strong> makes it bold </strong>
</ul>

<p> block line elements create blocks around content vs inline element which just flow with the text </p>

<p> To create an ordered list you have to: <br>
<ol> 
<li> write the opening tag ol
<li> add elements to the list with the tag li
  <ul> 
    <li>remember that li (just likep) doesn't necessarily need a closing tag as html will infer it when it sees the next tag of that type
    <li> ol and ul on the other hand alwyas require closing tags
  </ul>
<li> write a closing tag
</ol>
 
<p> In order to add an hyperlink, you need to use the a element, the href attribute and the url as follows <br>
  <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse"> Netflix </a> <br>
If you want the link to open in a new window rather than the one you're on, use the attribute target="_blank" <br>
 a url is composed of:<br>
 <ol>
 <li> A protocol, such as:
  <ul>
   <li> http
   <li> https
   <li> file
  </ul>
 <li> :// or :/// for files
 <li> the domain name or file path
</ol>

<p> To display images use the tag img and the attributes src (source of image-either url or file) and alt (text to show in place of image if it doesn't load) as follows: <br>
 <img src="https://placebear.com/800/600" alt="Bears">
</body>
</html>
