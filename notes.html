<p> A markup is a special text which tells html how to diplay stuff <br> </p>

<p> This is a list of markups: 
 <ul> 
    <li>br brakes <br>
    <li><em> em is for italicising text </em> <br>
    <li><sub> abc </sub> <br>
    <li><sup> abc </sup> </p>
    <li><strong> makes it bold </strong>
</ul>

<p> block line elements create blocks around content vs inline element which just flow with the text </p>

<p> To create an ordered list you have to: <br>
<ol> 
<li> write the opening tag ol
<li> add elements to the list with the tag li
  <ul> 
    <li>remember that li (just likep) doesn't necessarily need a closing tag as html will infer it when it sees the next tag of that type
    <li> ol and ul on the other hand alwyas require closing tags
  </ul>
<li> write a closing tag
</ol>
</p>

<p> In order to add an hyperlink, you need to use the a element and the href attribute as follows <br>
  <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse"> Netflix </a>
